Moreover, it can be easily augmented with Python code, as well as with larger extension packages such as `Pmw` (a third-party widget library); `Tix` (another widget library, and now a standard part of Python); `PIL` (an image-processing extension); and `ttk` (Tk themed widgets, also now a standard part of Python as of version 3.1).\n",

    "|`Pmw`|*Python Mega Widgets* is an extension toolkit for building high-level compound widgets in Python using the `tkinter` module. It extends the `tkinter` API with a collection of more sophisticated widgets for advanced GUI development and a framework for implementing some of your own. Among the precoded and extensible megawidgets shipped with the package are **notebooks**, **combo boxes**, **selection widgets**, **paned widgets**, **scrolled widgets**, **dialog windows**, **button boxes**, **balloon help**, and an interface to the **Blt graph widget**.|\n",
    "|`Tix`| A collection of more than 40 advanced widgets. This package is now a Python standard library module, called `tkinter`.tix. Like Tk, the underlying library is also shipped today with Python on Windows. In other words, on Windows, if you install Python, you also have `Tix` as a preinstalled library of additional widgets. `Tix` includes many of the same devices as `Pmw`, including **spin boxes**, **trees**, **tabbed notebooks**, **balloon help pop ups**, **paned windows**, and much more...|\n",
    "|`ttk`|Attempts to separate the code implementing a widget’s behavior from that implementing its appearance. Widget classes handle *state* and *callback* invocation, whereas widget appearance is managed separately by *themes*. Comes with *17 widgets*, *11* of which are already present in `tkinter` and are meant as replacements for some of tkinter’s standard widgets, and *6* of which are ***new*** — **Combobox**, **Notebook**, **Progressbar**, **Separator**, **Sizegrip** and **Treeview**.|\n",
    "|`PIL`|The *Python Imaging Library (PIL)* is an open source extension package that adds image-processing tools to Python. Among other things, it provides tools for *image thumbnails*, *transforms*, and *conversions*, and it extends the basic tkinter image object to add support for displaying many image file types. `PIL`, for instance, allows tkinter GUIs to display **JPEG**, **TIFF**, and **PNG** images not supported by the base tkinter toolkit itself (without extension, tkinter supports **GIFs** and a handful of **bitmap** formats).|"
